A tiny benchmark for parsers of Haskell
                                                         Kazu Yamamoto

This benchmark compares String, Lazy ByteString, and Lazy Text of
Parsec3. Support of Lazy Text for Lazy Text is found:

	https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/parsec3/commit/58c268c37e54a470c841c3ef5ecb7722f625552e

This benchmark parses /usr/share/dict/words and extracts the string
"tre". You need to prepare /usr/share/dict/words by yourself.

	% head -n 10000 /usr/share/dict/words > input

Then execute, the benchmark:

	% sh bench.sh

After execution, you can find "plot.png".
