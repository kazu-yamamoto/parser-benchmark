                                                         Kazu Yamamoto

This benchmark compares String, Lazy ByteString, and Lazy Text of
Parsec3. Support of Lazy Text for Lazy Text is found:

This benchmark parses a GNU Texi file and extract strings matched to
"@samp{...}". You need to prepare a GNU Texi file by yourself.  You
can download the following and save it as "input.texi" in this
directory.
